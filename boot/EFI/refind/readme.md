# refind efi file not included. cope.

catppuccin mocha from [catppuccin/refind](https://github.com/catppuccin/refind). the one from this repo is minified so its faster by 0.1 nanoseconds on low end hdds. you'll have to manually include the catppuccin icons (i dont wanna put their icons here)

also some things are rm'd so this git repo isn't super bloated. essentally what you want to do is just copy the files here to wherever you installed refind.
